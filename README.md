# Project_1_Clock
-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project goal was to develop an object oriented programming application that produced 2 clocks, one tracking 12-hour time and one trakcing 24-hour time. 

-What did you do particularly well?

I followed directions well. The formatting and presentation of the outputs was done right per the documentation provided for the assignment.

-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think that early on, my level of experience really shows. I was unable to wrap my head around running both clocks at the same time and confused myself by using the same values over and over again. I could improve the codes performance by using some temporary variables to mitigate the mixups.

-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I had no problem figuring out how to make the 12-hour clock, but using the same variable to track time across both clocks was problematic. I looked up a few clock programs to see what the 24-hour clock code would look like, which helped me track my math as the hours were counted up and gave me an idea of how to set limits on the mins and maxes for the clocks.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think that it was a great intorductory assignment and will be a good source of confidence to look back on to see what I am able to accomplish even when I feel like I won't be able to do something.
